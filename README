Adds all the photos in a folder to an album in Apple Photos, without importing any pictures.

This is useful when you have a folder of images that may contain images that you already have in your library.

Currently just searches by file names. 

Easiest use case I've found is to:
1. Import all the photos into your library, skipping duplicates
2. Run this script
3. Remove any extra photos that may have the same name, by sorting by date.

Success!
